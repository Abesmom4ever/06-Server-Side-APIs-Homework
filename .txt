After getting data from API fetch, OpenWeather only reacts to the inputted City, unless the country is abbreviated and separated by comma.

1) Need to write an if statement i think so
IF client inputs city, then drop down menu to provide all cities with same name from all relevant countries.
IF client inputs city and correctly abbreviated country, then drop down menu will provide city within the country.
IF the client inputs any other info, add alert letting them know no city was found.
EVEN IF client does not space the cities's names properly, the city will pop up with from all relevant countries

2) Attach each result to a listed item in the drop down menu

** appended "p" element when submit btn is clicked. But i want it to be a
** dropdown menu with the option to click it to get the specified lat and lon
